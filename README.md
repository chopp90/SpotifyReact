# SpotifyReact
Small React Project to test the Framework.  To combat some wierd behaviour of spotify's shuffle play, i wanted a small tool to pre-shuffle my playlists with some sort of algorythm/prerequisites. Bonus: Generate small playlist by providing some artist names/songs. Bons2: Show some account/user-data.
