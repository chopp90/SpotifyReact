      DISCLAIMER:  
      Some Clicks might alter or generate Playlists in your Spotify.

      ( well soon... maybe, so far playlist id's are hardcoded on the funcitonal pages )
      *Note: I don't think anyone can do anything here without being explicitly invited via the spotify-app-dashboard... but better safe then sorry!
