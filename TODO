Rough steps:

# Set up basic routing/layout etc.
# connect to spotify api.  ( Token/Auth hardcoded first?  DONT PUSH / gitignore )
# Make types for the needed classes/types.  EG. Playlist, Account, extend Playlist with customOrder?  ==> testing @types/spotify-api for now
Do something with expired auth token? ... get other token, first attempt is not for personal data!
Check Login state at home and redirect if expired?
Improve routing ( base app.tsx and headernavigation ) to read pages folder and do stuff with it automatically?
Loading/errorstates?
Make Service-class or something similiar to handle all the API stuff
Make a small Artist/Track Top view profile page
    => improve Artist: Make a button to switch between short/medium/long_term. (Cache?) Fetch more on maxScroll? 
        => adjust layout? kind of want a proper flex again, or could keep grid but center and adjust images a bit ( right is cut off )
Make a Song-Display Component
Make a Playlist Component to display Song-Displays?
Make Song-Display Drag&Drop for order in Playlist?
Make functions to shuffle/sort/order playlist
Make funtion to generate playlist based on songs in current playlist ( eg. top 5 + newest 2 songs for each artist that has a song in the list )
