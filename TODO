Rough steps:
Improve routing ( base app.tsx and headernavigation ) to read pages folder and do stuff with it automatically?
Loading/errorstates?
Make Song-Display Drag&Drop for order in Playlist?
Make functions to shuffle/sort/order playlist
Basic Sort Methods to shuffle page? maybe think of some flexible attribute sort function instead of hardcoding them over and over.
Figure out how to context-state-save User Object, or similiar. LocaleStorage would feel like a little cheating.
Fix populate for repeat Artists, make artist id unique somewhere.
Popule: prepare for > 100 songs at 10 artists, or cut amount of songs per artist down? dynamically? max(10, 100 / artistCount )
Add some ButtonPress Feedback, eg. song successfully queued sncakbar?
Funcationlity to queuing, provide some sort of feedback is song is already queued?  Show queue somewhere? dont sent queueing if already in queue  => guess showing queue somewhere is best.
improve refresh, first 401 now refreshes, but is lost. Auto refresh after a bit, keep track of last call and repeat after refresh?
properly set unique keys. at the bare minimum the ones that don't even have an index yet.

Provide draggable List for playlists?
Make Different Criterias selectable on UI instead of hardcoded?
Wierd special Idea: Use some sort of Machine Learning to shuffle list against criterias. ( value instead of hard-no ) And progress from there!
Do some funny Animation-stuff / slightly wierd css-stuff?
*   Animations in general, Transitions, box-shadow?, gradient
*   Wierd mouse-area stuff i saw in a short video somewhere?
